# Establishing a Developer Mindset :muscle:
## Growth Mindset

### Letter to Self:
It's truly frustrating to get stuck on a programming challenge. You have tried many different methods, yet it doesn’t seem to be working out. Having a strong-willed mindset is a great skill to have as a developer, and you improve on it with intentional practice in everyday software problem-solving.

There are many strategies available at your disposal. Remember that you don’t get very far doing it all on your own. Utilize your resources to get unstuck. Have you tried taking a break? Get up, walk for a bit, get some water, maybe a cup of freshly brewed coffee. Stretch your body and mind, and come back to it with a refreshed attitude.

You can also talk out loud about the issue. Rubber-ducky it. You won’t believe the wonders of sharing your thought process with someone else, outside of your own mind (it could be you if you are alone or a literal rubber-ducky).

Finally, you can always ask a more experienced developer, this could be other students, your instructor, or your mentor. Don’t be afraid to admit you are having trouble and don’t be afraid to ask for help.

#### **Additional Resources:**
- Use the internet: so vast and informational - Someone already faced your problem and provided a solution, use stack overflow.
- Read documentation - All the instructions from the original source are there.
- Search for tutorials - Youtube, if you are a visual learner.
- Subscribe to mailing lists to stay up to date with technology changes. **Goal:** find Front-End popular mailing lists.

__Current Skills that are key:__  
To maximize productivity remember the 15-minute rule: Remain focused for 15 minutes and attempt the problem on you own, use the web to find out how others have solved it. If you haven’t succeeded after the time expires, ask for help.

Know how to properly asks questions on forums: State the problem in simple writing, include what you are trying to accomplish, and finally what have you tried. It’s part of communicating clearly, and succinctly, and avoids getting an answer that you have already attempted but wasn’t successful.

The documentation should be your go-to source. It is necessary to learn how to navigate it, how it is organized, and how to quickly find what you are looking for.

It's important to keep in mind is that challenges are not avoidable, at times you will feel down, and unaccomplished because you haven’t made progress. It is necessary to keep a bird’s eye view of the situation and adopting a growth mindset. A growth mindset means that you see everything as an opportunity to learn and succeed no matter how long it takes you. You compete against yourself, and yourself only. **You strive to become better than yesterday, with the goal of learning something new each day.** *Patience* is key.
